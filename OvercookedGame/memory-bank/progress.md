## Step 5: Implementing 3D Character and Items [Completed]

- Enhanced the player character with a 3D voxel-style chef model:
  - Created a blocky character with detailed body parts (head, torso, arms, legs)
  - Added cosmetic elements including hair, sunglasses, and a jacket
  - Implemented walking animations that move arms and legs when the player moves
  - Added character rotation to face the direction of movement
  - Applied a shadow beneath the character for better visual grounding

- Upgraded items with 3D representations:
  - Converted items from 2D planes to 3D spheres with appropriate colors
  - Added state-specific appearances for items:
    - Raw: Regular colored spheres
    - Chopped: Flattened spheres with cutting lines on top
    - Cooked: Glowing spheres with particle effects (steam)
  - Implemented animations for cooked items with floating steam particles

- Added lighting to enhance the 3D visuals:
  - Ambient light to provide overall scene illumination
  - Directional light to create shadows and depth
  - Used MeshPhongMaterial for better light interaction on 3D models

- Improved item positioning:
  - Items appear higher above the player's head for better visibility
  - Items sit slightly above counters instead of directly on them
  - Cooked items have subtle animated particle effects

### Testing Notes
- The 3D character model is visible and animates correctly during movement
- Character rotates to face the direction of movement, giving better visual feedback
- Items have distinct 3D appearances based on their state (raw, chopped, cooked)
- Lighting creates depth and enhances the 3D visuals of the game
- All existing functionality (movement, item pickup/placement) works correctly with the new models

### Next Steps
- Proceed to implementing station-specific processing (chopping, cooking)
- Create recipe combining and scoring system
