# Project Progress

## Step 1: Setting up the Project [Completed]

- Created the project directory `OvercookedGame`
- Initialized npm and configured package.json
- Installed ThreeJS as a dependency
- Created index.html with canvas element for game rendering
- Created main.js with basic ThreeJS setup:
  - Configured an orthographic camera for 2D top-down view
  - Set up a WebGL renderer targeting the canvas
  - Added a simple green square to verify rendering
  - Implemented window resize handling
  - Created an animation loop
- Added a development server using http-server for testing
- Modified package.json to use ES modules for proper ThreeJS imports

### Testing Notes
- The basic ThreeJS scene is set up with a green square visible in the canvas
- The game canvas properly adapts to different screen sizes
- The development server can be started with `npm start` 

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 2: Implementing the Kitchen Layout
