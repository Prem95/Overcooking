# Project Progress

## Step 1: Setting up the Project [Completed]

- Created the project directory `OvercookedGame`
- Initialized npm and configured package.json
- Installed ThreeJS as a dependency
- Created index.html with canvas element for game rendering
- Created main.js with basic ThreeJS setup:
  - Configured an orthographic camera for 2D top-down view
  - Set up a WebGL renderer targeting the canvas
  - Added a simple green square to verify rendering
  - Implemented window resize handling
  - Created an animation loop
- Added a development server using http-server for testing
- Modified package.json to use ES modules for proper ThreeJS imports

### Testing Notes
- The basic ThreeJS scene is set up with a green square visible in the canvas
- The game canvas properly adapts to different screen sizes
- The development server can be started with `npm start` 

## Step 2: Implementing the Kitchen Layout [Completed]

- Defined constants for station and counter sizes
- Created a color scheme for different kitchen elements
- Implemented a kitchen layout with the following stations:
  - Pantry (green square)
  - Chopping Station (red square)
  - Cooking Station (orange square)
  - Plate Dispenser (grey square)
  - Serving Station (blue square)
- Added five counter spaces (light grey squares)
- Created text labels for each station and counter
- Stored references to all kitchen elements in a `kitchen` object
- Added metadata to each element (position, type, occupancy state) for future game logic

### Testing Notes
- All stations and counters are visible in the scene with appropriate colors
- Kitchen elements are arranged in a sensible layout with stations along the edges and counters in the center
- Each element has a text label showing its function
- The layout provides enough space for player movement

## Step 3: Implementing the Player Character and Controls [Completed]

- Created a white circular player character using CircleGeometry
- Positioned the player initially in the center of the kitchen
- Implemented keyboard controls:
  - WASD and arrow keys for movement
  - Space bar for future interactions
- Implemented collision detection:
  - Created a checkCollision function that checks for intersections between the player and kitchen elements
  - Prevented the player from moving through stations and counters
- Created mobile controls:
  - Added WASD button overlay at the bottom of the screen
  - Added a SPACE action button
  - Implemented touch event handling for all buttons
  - Set the overlay to only appear on mobile devices
- Added error message system:
  - Created function to display temporary error messages above the player's head
  - Implemented auto-removal of messages after 2 seconds
- Set up a centralized game state object to track:
  - Player position
  - Key presses
  - Held items (for future steps)
  - Error message state

### Testing Notes
- The player can be moved around the kitchen using WASD or arrow keys
- Collision detection prevents the player from moving through stations and counters
- On mobile devices, the control overlay appears and allows movement via touch
- Error messages can be displayed when needed (currently commented out for collisions)

## Step 4: Implementing the Item System [Completed]

- Defined item constants and types:
  - Added item size constant
  - Created color definitions for different ingredients (onion, tomato, meat)
  - Defined item types (onion, tomato, meat)
  - Added item states (raw, chopped, cooked) for future processing steps
- Implemented proximity detection:
  - Created a checkProximity function to detect when player is near stations or counters
  - Set an interaction radius that determines how close the player needs to be to interact
- Created item management functions:
  - createItem: Creates new items with proper visual representation and metadata
  - attachItemToPlayer: Attaches an item to the player (positioned above their head)
  - placeItemOnCounter: Places an item on a counter and updates all relevant states
  - pickUpItemFromCounter: Picks up an item from a counter and attaches it to player
- Implemented specific interaction handlers:
  - handlePantryInteraction: Creates a new onion and gives it to the player
  - handleCounterInteraction: Handles placing items on and picking them up from counters
  - handleInteraction: Main interaction function that determines what to do based on proximity
- Updated player movement to include held item movement
- Added appropriate error messages for invalid actions:
  - "Hands full!" when trying to pick up a new item while holding one
  - "Counter occupied!" when trying to place an item on an already occupied counter
  - "Nothing to pick up!" when trying to pick up from an empty counter
  - "Nothing nearby!" when trying to interact while not near any station or counter

### Testing Notes
- Player can get an onion from the pantry by standing nearby and pressing space
- The onion appears above the player's head and moves with the player
- Player can place the onion on an empty counter by standing nearby and pressing space
- Player can pick up an onion from a counter when nearby and pressing space
- Appropriate error messages are shown for invalid actions
- Interaction works on both desktop (space key) and mobile (space button)

## Step 5: Implementing Station Interactions [Completed]

- Added dedicated counters directly in front of chopping and cooking stations
- Implemented progress bar UI:
  - Created a shader-based progress bar that fills as processing continues
  - Positioned the bar above the player's head during interactions
  - Included animations for smooth filling effect
- Implemented chopping mechanic:
  - Added a handleChoppingInteraction function that processes raw items into chopped items
  - Enforced a 3-second chopping time with visual progress indicator
  - Added validation to ensure only raw items can be chopped
  - Added appropriate error messages for invalid operations
- Implemented cooking mechanic:
  - Added a handleCookingInteraction function that processes chopped items into cooked items
  - Enforced a 5-second cooking time with visual progress indicator
  - Added validation to ensure only chopped items can be cooked
  - Added appropriate error messages for invalid operations
- Updated game state to track processing progress:
  - Added a processingInProgress flag to prevent multiple simultaneous operations
  - Added a progressBar reference for managing the UI element
- Enhanced interaction system to handle station-specific interactions:
  - Updated handleInteraction function to check proximity to stations
  - Added specific handling for chopping and cooking stations

### Testing Notes
- Player can place raw items on the counter in front of the chopping station
- Standing near the chopping station and pressing space starts the chopping process
- A progress bar appears and fills over 3 seconds
- After completion, the raw item is replaced with a chopped version
- Player can move the chopped item to the counter in front of the cooking station
- Standing near the cooking station and pressing space starts the cooking process
- A progress bar appears and fills over 5 seconds
- After completion, the chopped item is replaced with a cooked version
- Appropriate error messages appear when:
  - Trying to chop an empty counter: "Nothing to chop!"
  - Trying to cook an empty counter: "Nothing to cook!"
  - Trying to cook a raw item: "Chop it first!"
  - Trying to process an already processed item: "Already processed!"
  - Trying to start a new process while one is ongoing: "Already processing!"

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 6: Plates and Assembling Dishes

## Enhanced 3D Kitchen Environment [Completed]

- Redesigned the kitchen layout based on the design.md specifications:
  - Created a U-shaped counter layout with stations along the edges
  - Added a central island counter for more gameplay options
  - Ensured appropriate spacing for player movement
  
- Enhanced visual details of kitchen stations:
  - Added shelves with food items to the pantry
  - Added cutting marks and improved knife details to the chopping station
  - Added burner and control knobs to the cooking station
  - Added dispenser mechanism and button to the plate station
  - Added window frame and bell details to the serving station
  - Added wood texture details to counters
  
- Implemented advanced environmental elements:
  - Added a checkered floor pattern using canvas textures
  - Added walls to create a proper kitchen boundary
  - Added decorative elements including a picture frame and potted plant
  
- Improved camera and lighting for better 3D visualization:
  - Adjusted camera to provide a better isometric view of the kitchen
  - Added warm ambient lighting for a cozy atmosphere
  - Implemented directional lighting with shadows
  - Added secondary light source for improved depth perception
  - Enabled shadow mapping for enhanced realism
  
- Updated interaction handlers to work with the new kitchen layout:
  - Adjusted counter positions for chopping and cooking stations
  - Maintained all existing functionality with the new layout

### Testing Notes
- The kitchen now has a more realistic and visually appealing 3D appearance
- The U-shaped counter layout creates a more intuitive workflow
- Stations are more visually distinctive and recognizable
- Lighting and shadows create better depth perception
- All existing gameplay mechanics continue to work with the new layout
