# Project Progress

## Step 1: Setting up the Project [Completed]

- Created the project directory `OvercookedGame`
- Initialized npm and configured package.json
- Installed ThreeJS as a dependency
- Created index.html with canvas element for game rendering
- Created main.js with basic ThreeJS setup:
  - Configured an orthographic camera for 2D top-down view
  - Set up a WebGL renderer targeting the canvas
  - Added a simple green square to verify rendering
  - Implemented window resize handling
  - Created an animation loop
- Added a development server using http-server for testing
- Modified package.json to use ES modules for proper ThreeJS imports

### Testing Notes
- The basic ThreeJS scene is set up with a green square visible in the canvas
- The game canvas properly adapts to different screen sizes
- The development server can be started with `npm start` 

## Step 2: Implementing the Kitchen Layout [Completed]

- Defined constants for station and counter sizes
- Created a color scheme for different kitchen elements
- Implemented a kitchen layout with the following stations:
  - Pantry (green square)
  - Chopping Station (red square)
  - Cooking Station (orange square)
  - Plate Dispenser (grey square)
  - Serving Station (blue square)
- Added five counter spaces (light grey squares)
- Created text labels for each station and counter
- Stored references to all kitchen elements in a `kitchen` object
- Added metadata to each element (position, type, occupancy state) for future game logic

### Testing Notes
- All stations and counters are visible in the scene with appropriate colors
- Kitchen elements are arranged in a sensible layout with stations along the edges and counters in the center
- Each element has a text label showing its function
- The layout provides enough space for player movement

## Step 3: Implementing the Player Character and Controls [Completed]

- Created a white circular player character using CircleGeometry
- Positioned the player initially in the center of the kitchen
- Implemented keyboard controls:
  - WASD and arrow keys for movement
  - Space bar for future interactions
- Implemented collision detection:
  - Created a checkCollision function that checks for intersections between the player and kitchen elements
  - Prevented the player from moving through stations and counters
- Created mobile controls:
  - Added WASD button overlay at the bottom of the screen
  - Added a SPACE action button
  - Implemented touch event handling for all buttons
  - Set the overlay to only appear on mobile devices
- Added error message system:
  - Created function to display temporary error messages above the player's head
  - Implemented auto-removal of messages after 2 seconds
- Set up a centralized game state object to track:
  - Player position
  - Key presses
  - Held items (for future steps)
  - Error message state

### Testing Notes
- The player can be moved around the kitchen using WASD or arrow keys
- Collision detection prevents the player from moving through stations and counters

  - Added item states (raw, chopped, cooked) for future processing steps
- Implemented proximity detection:
  - Created a checkProximity function to detect when player is near stations or counters
  - Set an interaction radius that determines how close the player needs to be to interact
- Created item management functions:
  - createItem: Creates new items with proper visual representation and metadata
  - attachItemToPlayer: Attaches an item to the player (positioned above their head)
  - placeItemOnCounter: Places an item on a counter and updates all relevant states
  - pickUpItemFromCounter: Picks up an item from a counter and attaches it to player
- Implemented specific interaction handlers:
  - handlePantryInteraction: Creates a new onion and gives it to the player
  - handleCounterInteraction: Handles placing items on and picking them up from counters
  - handleInteraction: Main interaction function that determines what to do based on proximity
- Updated player movement to include held item movement
- Added appropriate error messages for invalid actions:
  - "Hands full!" when trying to pick up a new item while holding one
  - "Counter occupied!" when trying to place an item on an already occupied counter
  - "Nothing to pick up!" when trying to pick up from an empty counter
  - "Nothing nearby!" when trying to interact while not near any station or counter

### Testing Notes

- After completion, the raw item is replaced with a chopped version
- Player can move the chopped item to the counter in front of the cooking station
- Standing near the cooking station and pressing space starts the cooking process
- A progress bar appears and fills over 5 seconds
- After completion, the chopped item is replaced with a cooked version
- Appropriate error messages appear when:
  - Trying to chop an empty counter: "Nothing to chop!"
  - Trying to cook an empty counter: "Nothing to cook!"
  - Trying to cook a raw item: "Chop it first!"
  - Trying to process an already processed item: "Already processed!"
  - Trying to start a new process while one is ongoing: "Already processing!"
