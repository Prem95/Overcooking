# Project Progress

## Step 1: Setting up the Project [Completed]

- Created the project directory `OvercookedGame`
- Initialized npm and configured package.json
- Installed ThreeJS as a dependency
- Created index.html with canvas element for game rendering
- Created main.js with basic ThreeJS setup:
  - Configured an orthographic camera for 2D top-down view
  - Set up a WebGL renderer targeting the canvas
  - Added a simple green square to verify rendering
  - Implemented window resize handling
  - Created an animation loop
- Added a development server using http-server for testing
- Modified package.json to use ES modules for proper ThreeJS imports

### Testing Notes
- The basic ThreeJS scene is set up with a green square visible in the canvas
- The game canvas properly adapts to different screen sizes
- The development server can be started with `npm start` 

## Step 2: Implementing the Kitchen Layout [Completed]

- Defined constants for station and counter sizes
- Created a color scheme for different kitchen elements
- Implemented a kitchen layout with the following stations:
  - Pantry (green square)
  - Chopping Station (red square)
  - Cooking Station (orange square)
  - Plate Dispenser (grey square)
  - Serving Station (blue square)
- Added five counter spaces (light grey squares)
- Created text labels for each station and counter
- Stored references to all kitchen elements in a `kitchen` object
- Added metadata to each element (position, type, occupancy state) for future game logic

### Testing Notes
- All stations and counters are visible in the scene with appropriate colors
- Kitchen elements are arranged in a sensible layout with stations along the edges and counters in the center
- Each element has a text label showing its function
- The layout provides enough space for player movement

## Step 3: Implementing the Player Character and Controls [Completed]

- Created a white circular player character using CircleGeometry
- Positioned the player initially in the center of the kitchen
- Implemented keyboard controls:
  - WASD and arrow keys for movement
  - Space bar for future interactions
- Implemented collision detection:
  - Created a checkCollision function that checks for intersections between the player and kitchen elements
  - Prevented the player from moving through stations and counters
- Created mobile controls:
  - Added WASD button overlay at the bottom of the screen
  - Added a SPACE action button
  - Implemented touch event handling for all buttons
  - Set the overlay to only appear on mobile devices
- Added error message system:
  - Created function to display temporary error messages above the player's head
  - Implemented auto-removal of messages after 2 seconds
- Set up a centralized game state object to track:
  - Player position
  - Key presses
  - Held items (for future steps)
  - Error message state

### Testing Notes
- The player can be moved around the kitchen using WASD or arrow keys
- Collision detection prevents the player from moving through stations and counters
- On mobile devices, the control overlay appears and allows movement via touch
- Error messages can be displayed when needed (currently commented out for collisions)

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Step 4: Implementing the Item System
